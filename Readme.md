# PdfRenamer

A program that renames your PDF articles based on their title, author, publication year, and the publisher; therefore the file-names would become more search friendly.

For example after downloading a typical article from [JMLR](http://www.jmlr.org), the file was named `taylor11a.pdf`, but `PdfRenamer` suggests it to be renamed as:  
*"Two Distributed-State Models For Generating High-Dimensional Time Series - Graham W. Taylor - Geoffrey E. Hinton - Sam T. Roweis - JMLR - 2011.pdf"*

However you are free to select the renaming style.
